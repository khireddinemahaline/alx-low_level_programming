in this section we discover a lot of things and lot of work been done here i will mentioned only some important nome :
#### Single quotes vs. double quotes in C or C++ : 
In C and C++ the single quote is used to identify the single character, and double quotes are used for string literals
#### some write function:
* putchar() Function
* puts() Function
* printf() function

#### statment if , else, for, while
1. if else statment are writen in this way :
if(boolean_expression) {
   /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true */
} else {
   /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is false */
}

2. while stament are written in this way:
while(expression) {
   statement(s);
}

3. for loop :
 for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}

##### some trick
 * The digits 0 thru 9 are encoded as the consecutive numbers 48 thru 57
